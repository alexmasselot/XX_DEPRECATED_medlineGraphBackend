#Medline Graph

The purpose of the project is to visualize scientific collaborations in the biomedical literature.

Out of more ~ 24 millions publications downloaded from  [medline](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.html), author affiliations can be extracted, and linked to geographical coordinates.
Distant collaborations can therefore be tagged when authors are not affiliated to the same institution, or city.

#Materials

## Publications
 
ftp://ftp.nlm.nih.gov/nlmdata/.medlease/gz

## Geo location
Several solutions do exist. We used two of them:

 * [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) project provides a *"geographical database covers all countries and contains over eight million placenames that are available for download free of charge"*, under a Creative Commons 3 License.
 * [mapquest](https://developer.mapquest.com/products/geocoding/) offers a batch possibility with a textual fields. It is used for affiliation not resolved by the first method
